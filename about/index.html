Working as a content editor for a collector car auction company in Arizona, I decided that while I won&apos;t be able to take my job with me on our next move, I could be doing SO much more than just editing &mdash; and without the restrictions</p>

When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I&apos;d found something amazing that gave me the freedom and versatility I was looking for in my work, and something that challenged me to develop more and more new skills. Now I&apos;m dedicated to making the full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to do what I love.</p>
